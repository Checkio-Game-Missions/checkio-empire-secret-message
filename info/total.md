Ever tried to send a secret message to someone without using the crypted channel? 
You could use public communication to tell your secret.
Even if someone finds your message, itâ€™s easy to brush them off and that its paranoia and a bogus conspiracy theory.
That's why we would try to use one of this method for squad communication.

You are given a chunk of text. Gather all capital letters in one word in the order that they appear in the text.

For example: text = "**H**ow are you? **E**h, ok. **L**ow or **L**ower? **O**hhh.",
if we collect all of the capital letters, we get the message "HELLO".

**Input:** A text as a string. 

**Output:** The secret message as a string or an empty string.

**Example:**

```python
find_message("How are you? Eh, ok. Low or Lower? Ohhh.") == "HELLO"
find_message("hello world!") == ""
```
**How it is used:**

It's useful

**Precondition:**
```python
0 < len(text) <= 1000
all(ch in string.printable for ch in text)
```
